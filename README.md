# doc2vec-IMDB-sentimentanalysis
sentiment analysis of the IMDB movie-comment data using doc2vec. It is just a tiny example to get familiar with the gensim and doc2vec.

## notice
that  i have already already writen all the train/pos texts and train/neg texts into one text file, therefore there is no code showing how to concatenate those files.However it mostly like the code concatenatint the test files.
