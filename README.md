# doc2vec-IMDB-sentimentanalysis
## Introduction
sentiment analysis of the IMDB movie-comment data using doc2vec. It is just a tiny example to get familiar with the gensim and doc2vec.

## Notice
that  i have already already writen all the train/pos texts,train/neg and train/unsup texts into one text file, therefore there is no code showing how to concatenate those files.However it mostly like the code concatenatint the test files.

## Score
the clf(Logistic Regression) scores 0.87. it is quite impressing.
